# How the backend server is created
1. Creatd a user which takes 3 parameters full name, email and password. Enforce strong password rule and add validation for email and full name.
API Endpoint:

POST: /user/create 

2. Update the user details (full name and password only). Email is not updated at any point. Proper error msg is thrown if user is not present in the database.
API Endpoint:

PUT: /user/edit – Add validations for full name and password

3. Delete the user by taking the user's email as input
Api Endpoint:

DELETE: /user/delete

4. Get all the user's full name, email addresses and passwords stored in the database
API Endpoint:

GET: /user/getAll

Added Validation for Name, email and password.

The bcrypt npm package is one of the most used packages to work with passwords in JavaScript.
This is security 101, but it’s worth mentioning for new developers: you never store a password in plain text in the database or in any other place. You just don’t.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
